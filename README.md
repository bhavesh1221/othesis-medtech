In this project i have used Angular as UI framework and Angular material as styling framework.
I have focused more on functionality part then styling.
**folder structure:**
* I have created a shared folder where there are two components Navbar and Sidebar which are going to be used in Every page
* Then i have created there is a home component where i have written the main logic of drag and drop feature which works smoothly as user drags and drops the data from template to root cancal section and vice versa.
* written code is easy to understand for any new Developer.
* as per given mock up, if user drags the entity to bottom of list, then it will automatically will be scrolling down

**UI**
UI is so smooth and user friendly, easy to understand.
